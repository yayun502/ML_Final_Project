# Final Project
**◾ Kaggle Dataset**  
&nbsp; https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-aug-2022/submissions  
**◾ Model Link**   
&nbsp; 1. within Github  
&nbsp; https://github.com/yayun502/ML_Final_Project/blob/dcbd5f1ca8de30001e73c6681cce007d8939305d/model_best_publicScore.pkl   
&nbsp; 2. within Google drive (backup)  
&nbsp; https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rxJesfU_IzRIXDxnWHz887C8z7FjgQGb?usp=share_link
  
**◾ Kaggle score**  
best private: 0.58999 (w/public:0.58826)  
best public: 0.58848 (w/private: 0.58992) &rarr; sum of private and public scores is higher (model saved/inference code reproduce this)    
  
**◾ Submission file reproducing**  
* Steps:  
1. Download files needed  
&nbsp; (1) dataset &rarr; from this repository / Kaggle   
&nbsp; (2) ipynb  &rarr; from this repository  
&nbsp; (3) trained model  &rarr; from this repository / Google drive  
2. Ensure the above files in same level position (ex.same folder)   
3. Execute 0813304_Final_reference.ipynb  
&rarr; reproduced file named as 'submission_best_publicScore_pickled.csv'  
  
【Alternative way】  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Train model and directly derived submission file by executing 0813304_Final_train.ipynb  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rarr; derived file named as 'submission_best_publicScore.csv' (same as 'submission_best_publicScore_pickled.csv')  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rarr; also, you can derive 'submission_best_privateScore.csv' at the same time  
&emsp;    
* I execute on VScode environment, so you need to add some path manually if executing on Google Colab.
